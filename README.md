# Sentiment_Analysis

Sentiment Analysis Classification with ML and DL Models using the Women's E-Commerce Clothing Reviews dataset involves the application of machine learning and deep learning techniques to discern and categorize sentiments expressed in online reviews.

The key aspect of this sentiment analysis is to analyze the body of the “Review Text” to understand the opinion expressed by it. These sentiments were quantified with a positive or negative value, called polarity. The overall sentiment is often inferred as positive, neutral, or negative from the sign of the polarity score.

Leveraging this dataset, the models aim to understand the sentiment behind reviews related to women's clothing in e-commerce. The goal is to develop accurate classifiers that can automatically identify whether a review expresses positive, negative, or neutral sentiments, providing valuable insights for businesses in the fashion retail sector. Through the utilization of both traditional machine learning algorithms and advanced deep learning architectures, the project seeks to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of sentiment analysis in the context of women's clothing reviews.
